=========================================
Welcome to mckit-nuclides Documentation!
=========================================

.. note::
   This documentation is currently under active development.

Overview
========

The ``mckit-nuclides`` module provides comprehensive data and utilities for working with chemical elements and nuclides,
including natural abundance information. The package is specifically designed for neutronics applications and high-performance data processing.

Key Features
------------

- **Efficient Data Handling**: Built on `Polars <https://pola.rs/>`_ for high-performance tabular operations
- **Natural Abundance Expansion**: Tools to expand natural isotopic compositions
- **Bulk Operations**: Optimized for massive datasets common in computational neutronics
- **(TODO) Format Support**: Utilities for various nuclear data formats (MCNP, FISPACT, OpenMC)

.. note::
   There's much more mature and data rich package `mendeleev <https://github.com/lmmentel/mendeleev>`_. 
   However, ``mckit-nuclides`` specializes in neutronics-oriented bulk operations and is optimized for performance with large datasets 
   such as those generated by `Rigorous 2-Step <https://github.com/svalinn/r2s-act/blob/master/docs/r2s-userguide.rst>`_ calculations.
   We tried pandas, sqlite, xarray for bulk operations. Polars for the moment seems the best alternative.
   Besides, mckit-nuclides can be used just as compact (almost no overhead) data storage 
   to be imported to some fast database 
   like `duckdb <https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb.git>`_ or `chDB <https://clickhouse.com/docs/chdb>`_.
   Eventually, we could migrate this code and data to Rust - the Polars native language.

Core Functionality
==================

- Expand natural isotopic abundances
- Perform bulk operations on nuclide data
- Join and filter large datasets efficiently
- Convert between different composition formats

Installation
============

**From PyPI (Recommended):**

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install mckit-nuclides

**With UV Package Manager:**

.. code-block:: bash
   
   uv add mckit-nuclides

**From Source:**

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install git+https://github.com/MC-kit/mckit-nuclides.git

Roadmap & Future Development
============================

.. todo::
   
   Move materials importing, merging, and export functionality to this package

Planned Features:
-----------------

- ☐ Parse and print MCNP composition formats (consolidating functionality from mckit, ne, pyne, f4enix)
- ☐ Support for FISPACT composition formats
- ☐ Support for OpenMC composition formats  
- ☐ Algorithms for composition merging by weight and atomic fractions
- ☐ Standard composition database (similar to `f4enix <https://github.com/Fusion4Energy/F4Enix/tree/main>`_)
- ☐ Mixture decomposition into standardized composition sets
